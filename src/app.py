"""iCopy-X application entry point.

Application launcher with the staged-update fallback introduced in PR #14.

Boot chain:
    ipk_starter.py -> app.py -> main.main() -> application.startApp()

On each boot, this script checks for a staged firmware update in
    /home/pi/ipk_app_new. If present, it swaps it into /home/pi/ipk_app_main
    (the live application directory), then launches the app.

Staged files are checked before activation and a failed rename or exec
attempt restores the previous application when possible. The backup is
retained after exec; this is not a boot-health or power-loss recovery system.
USB accessory discovery belongs to ics_decoder, not this installation step.
